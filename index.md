# GIRA3D Registration

GIRA3D Registration provides C++ and MATLAB implementations for
distribution-to-distribution registration of Gaussian mixture models
\[1\]. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) \[2\] software
using GTSAM \[3\] is also included in this module. Python bindings
enable integration into a larger number of projects.

Features of this module include:

*  A registration class with support for three variants of
registration:
    * anistropic,
	* isoplanar, and
	* isoplanarhybrid.

* Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) tools.

* Examples for running the registration and SLAM code.

* Visualization tools based on Open3D for Python and MATLAB.

* Dataset processing and plotting tools.
